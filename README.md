## PSForms - A PowerShell module to create Windows Forms

Welcome to this project!

I have created a PowerShell module to allow the quick and easy creation of a grid-based Windows Form that can be used as a GUI for a PowerShell based solution.

I will continue to update this module with additional features as I find the need for them and I'll fix any issues that I find.  If you find any issues or would like any additions made, please feel free to contact me.

To learn about the use of the module, please go to the Wiki where I have put together a short tutorial
